plan:
  . update the readme.md
  . 

rustGOL:
  . proper edge handling for
    . non-torus
    . torus
  . time profiling
  . structures.txt support
  . try openCL/openGL on this
  . 

pyGOL:
  . import path of structures.txt from addStructure script. just to do less code duplication
  . maybe yeet older implementations
  . seperate folder for pyGOL
  . 

maybe:
  . implement the rust implementation in
    . python - just to see if its faster than the last
    . go - to see how fast rust/go is (also multi-thread)
  . improve the structure import process for more convinience
  . 

todo features:
  . a consistant board for benchmark instead of randomised
  . a better way to display cells:
    . a graphics library solution instead of curses
    . some kinda interactive play
  . ability to slow dows the tick rate (something like wait(200ms - start):
  . use █ as a live cell, and black version of that ('\33[30m█\33[0m') as dead cell, (dosent work in curses)
  .
