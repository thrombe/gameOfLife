# gameOfLife
my attempt at game of life in python


# info
- Conway.py is my first try implementation (not the fastest)
- Conway2.py is done with more optimised algorithm
- Conway2Curses.py is just the same as Conway2.py but uses the curses module to display the cells. its less flickering than the previous two
- to add more structures, get an accurate screenshot of the structure, paste it in structureImages folder, run addStructure.py(you might have to edit the options), enter the name when it asks for it. and the structure will be added to the list.
- you can access these structures by editing the options in the Conway scripts (instructions in script)(scroll down to see the options)

# options
both Conway2 have options to edit, with explanation beside it. you just scroll down to the very bottom to see them
